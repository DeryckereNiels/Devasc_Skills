# Devasc_Skills
**Github**
* Task preparation:
    * Go to github.com, create private repository and copy link to repository
    * Create folder Devasc_Skills => mkdir Devasc_Skills
* Task implementation:
    * Clone repository to directory Devasc_skills => git clone https://github.com/DeryckereNiels/Devasc_Skills.git Devasc_Skills/
    * The reason I used clone is because then you don't have problems with the branch naming (master => main)

* Task troubleshooting: Not Applicable
* Task verification:  
    * Link to repository https://github.com/DeryckereNiels/Devasc_Skills.git
